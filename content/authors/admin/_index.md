I am a Ph.D. in Geotechnical Engineering at Western University. My current research include offshore the ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) design of onshore and offshore foundations. My research interests also include statistical interpretation of geotechnical data and reliability-based design of geotechnical structures.

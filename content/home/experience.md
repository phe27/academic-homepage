> * <span style="color:#6495ED; font-size:16pt;">*VHMT failure envelopes for circular foundations with a zero-tension interface*</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">Analyzed VHMT failure envelops for different types of soils (e.g. clay & sand) and foundations (e.g. surface and embedded) under combined VHMT loading using finite element analysis (ABAQUS).</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">For undrained soil conditions, the effects of soil strength heterogeneity, foundation embedment and surficial crust (i.e. crust shear strength and thickness) have been investigated. For drained soil conditions, cohesive-frictional soils have been considered.</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">Developed 4-D analytical expressions for the VHMT failure envelopes of circular foundations that can aid the bearing capacity assessment for shallow circular foundations under complex VHMT loading conditions.</span>
> * <span style="color:#6495ED; font-size:16pt;">*Coupled foundation stiffnesses for circular foundations*</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">Studied the effects of soil stiffness anisotropy, stiffness heterogeneity and foundation embedment on the stiffness for circular foundations using finite element analysis (ABAQUS).</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">Proposed analytical foundation stiffnesses considering soil stiffness anisotropy, stiffness heterogeneity and foundation embedment.</span>
> * <span style="color:#6495ED; font-size:16pt;">*Joint industry research project*</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">Conducted field testing to measure wind and wind turbine foundation vibrations in a Canadian wind farm to characterize wind-structure-foundation interactions.</span>
>    - <span style="font-size:14pt;">Developed analytical models for estimating the remaining fatigue life of wind turbines using reliability analyses.</span>

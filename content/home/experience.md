> * <span style="color:#6495ED; font-size:16pt;">*VHMT failure envelopes for circular foundations with a zero-tension interface*</span>
    1. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Analyzed VHMT failure envelops for different types of soils (e.g. clay & sand) and foundations (e.g. surface and embedded) under combined VHMT loading using finite element analysis.</span>
    2. <span style="font-size:14pt;">For undrained soil conditions, the effects of soil strength heterogeneity, foundation embedment and surficial crust (i.e. crust shear strength and thickness) have been investigated. For drained soil conditions, cohesive-frictional soils have been considered.</span>
    3. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Developed 4-D analytical expressions for the VHMT failure envelope of circular foundations that can aid the assessment of the ultimate limit states of shallow circular foundations under complex VHMT loading conditions.</span>
> * <span style="color:#6495ED; font-size:16pt;">*Coupled foundation stiffness for circular foundations*</span>
    1. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Studied the effects of soil stiffness anisotropy, stiffness heterogeneity and foundation embedment on the stiffness of circular foundations using finite element analysis.</span>
    2. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Proposed analytical foundation stiffnesses considering soil stiffness anisotropy, stiffness heterogeneity and foundation embedment.</span>
> * <span style="color:#6495ED; font-size:16pt;">*Industry-university collaboration project*</span>
    1. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Conducted field tests to measure wind and wind turbine foundation vibrations in a wind farm to characterize the wind-structure-foundation interaction.</span>
    2. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Developed analytical models to estimate the remaining fatigue life of wind turbines using reliability analyses.</span>

    1. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Conducted dynamic triaxial and resonant column tests on thawing soils.</span>
    2. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Established analytical models for characterizing wave propagations in surrounding soils induced by subway operation.</span>
    3. <span style="font-size:14pt;">Created numerical models for an operating subway using finite element analysis.</span>
